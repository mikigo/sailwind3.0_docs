## Creating a PDF

You can create an intelligent PDF of your schematic, choosing which sheets you want to share and show to others in your organization. You can create the PDF in full-color or black and white, with hyperlinks to part attributes, and with search capabilities, making it easy to locate parts and nets. Once you locate a net, you can find other instances of it through the entire schematic, even when the net is on a different page. You can also create a black and white, non-searchable PDF of your schematic.

## Setting Up a Pen Plotter

Before you can output your design to a pen plotter, specific options need to be configured so that the output is correctly reproduced by the plotting device. Use the Pen Plotter Setup dialog box to set various options for the plotter.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Plot menu item.   
2. In the Plot dialog box, click Setup.   
3. Type the number of pens (1-16) in your device, and type the pen line width in mils.   
4. Select the Rotate Axis check box to reverse the X and Y axes of the design.   
5. To assign colors, click a Selected Color tile, and then click a pen number in the Pen Colors area. Repeat this step for every pen listed.   
6. Click a Plotting Size button, or click Other to define a custom size. If you click Other, type the X and Y dimensions to use.   
7. In the Device list, select the plotter device to use.  

## Adding a New Pen Plotter

Use the Pen Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box to add a new pen plotter to the list of available plotters.  

**Restrictions and Limitations**  

You can also edit the data for an existing plotter, but only if it is a custom setup.   
• You cannot modify the SailWind-supplied advanced plotter settings.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Plot menu item.   
2. In the Plot dialog box, click the Setup button.   
3. In the Pen Plotter Setup dialog box, click the Advanced button.   
4. Type the name of a different pen plotter you want to use. Exception: Do not reuse one of the existing, supplied device names.   
5. In the device type list, select the interface language the plotter uses: HPGL or HGML.   
6. Set the plotter resolution by providing a scaling ratio. Type a number in the Multiplier and Divisor boxes. The ratio defined is the scale factor to convert from mils (0.001 in) to plotter units. Example: Most Hewlett-Packard plotters have a resolution of $0.025\mathrm{~mm}$ or $1/40~\mathsf{m m}$ . This means that a distance of one inch (1000 mils) is 1016 plotter units $(25.4\times40)$ . So a ratio of 1016 to 1000 would be defined. The ratio actually used is 254 to 250 which is the same as 1016 to 1000.   
7. Select the Origin at Center check box if the origin of the plotter is at the center of the paper. Clear this check box if the origin is in the lower left corner or other location.   
8. Click OK to return to the Pen Plot Setup dialog box.   
9. Click OK to return to the Plot dialog box.
