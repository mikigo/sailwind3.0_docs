# Chapter 8 Special Schematic Symbols  

Special Symbols in SailWind Logic include power symbols, ground symbols, and off-page reference symbols. SailWind Logic enables only one part definition in the library for Special Symbols. For this reason, the options for these types are grayed out and unavailable when you are in the Part Editor and you select File menu $>$ New. You can only modify the existing symbols or add new symbols to the part definition.

## Updating Special Symbol Mappings  

You can change the assignment or “mapping” of a special symbol using the Update from Library function For example, you can assign a new ground symbol to both a common ground and an analog ground.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the Tools $>$ Update from Library menu item.  

2. In the Mode area of the Update From Library Dialog Box, choose “Update design from library.”  

3. In the Items area, select one or more of the following check boxes:  

• Off-page symbols • Ground symbols Power symbols  

4. Click OK.  

5. In the Schematic Symbol column of the Remap Special Symbols Dialog Box, locate the power, ground, or off-page symbol that you want to re-map double-click on the corresponding Library Symbol box and then select the new symbol that you want to assign to the schematic symbol.  

Note:   
Only symbols currently associated with the special symbols in your library appear in the Library Symbol dropdown list.  

6. Repeat step 4 for every symbol you want to re-map.  

7. Click OK.  

SailWind Logic updates the symbols and generates the Update From Library report on page 206.  

The updated symbols appear in the “Mapped to” column of the report.  

## Management of Special Symbols in the Library  

Special Symbols are those used to create off-page reference, power and ground symbols, and connectors. The default location of these special symbols is the C:\<install_folder>\<version>\Libraries.  

Reinstalling the library will overwrite the common library files. If you modify a special symbol and want to keep the change, use Library/Export to transfer the symbol from the C:\<install_folder>\<version> \Libraries folder to the C:\<install_folder>\<version>\Libraries\usr folder or to another library name.
