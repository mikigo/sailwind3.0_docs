# Chapter 14 Hierarchical Design  

SailWind Logic supports hierarchical design where you can create symbols to represent entire subschematics and show system interactivity at a higher level. You can create hierarchy from either the top down or the bottom up.

## Hierarchical Design Overview

Using hierarchical design, you can create high-level symbols to represent complex sub-schematics, or repetitive elements in your design. You can create a hierarchy by using either the top down or the bottom up design strategy.  

• Top down — You define a hierarchical symbol and then the underlying logic. Bottom up — You create a schematic, then define the hierarchical symbol for the schematic.  

You can also assign or unassign hierarchical connections in the Hierarchical Component properties on page 296 dialog box.  

Level 0 is the top design level that contains the design contents. Numbered sheets from sheet 1 to 1024 represent the design contents. A SailWind Logic design cannot exceed a total number of 1024 hierarchical and numbered sheets.  

You can navigate the hierarchy with the Push Hierarchy on page 269 and Pop Hierarchy on page 270 commands on the View menu.  

When a hierarchical symbol is copied, any existing underlying schematic content is also copied. SailWind Logic updates the reference designator names of the underlying symbols. There is a one-to-one correspondence between hierarchy symbols and a schematic sheet. The underlying logic for duplicated hierarchical symbols is stored as a unique sheet, and can be edited without affecting the logic of other hierarchical symbols. Even though you copy a hierarchical symbol, its underlying schematics can be completely different from the copied symbol’s underlying schematics.  

## Creating a Top-Down Hierarchy

In top-down design, you create a hierarchical symbol before the underlying schematic exists. This enables you to create the container object and then populate it with the lower level design elements. Pin names tie together signals between hierarchical levels.  

SailWind Logic ties together all instances of a common signal name, regardless of where they are found in the design, into a single connection net. You establish connectivity across the hierarchy by using the same signal name in the underlying logic.  

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that the off-page signals in the underlying schematic are consistent with the pin names in the hierarchical symbol.  

**Procedure** 

1. On the Schematic Editing toolbar, click the New Hierarchical Symbol button.  

2. In the Hierarchical Symbol Wizard Dialog Box, in the Hierarchical Sheet area, type the symbol name in the Sheet Name text box.   
3. Select your preferred Pin Decal for both input and output pins from the appropriate dropdown list boxes.   
4. Specify the Pin Count for both input and output pins. The Preview area displays the symbol outline.  

5. Click OK. The hierarchical symbol appears in the Part Editor on page 109 window.  

!Tip  

Because the symbol is a hierarchical one, it has no pin numbers. The pin name associated with pins of the hierarchical symbol identify the net name of the connection that is tied to the pin. All pins on a hierarchical symbol must have a pin name. You cannot complete the hierarchical symbol until you assign a name to each pin.  

6. In the Part Editor, double-click each pin to open the Terminal Properties dialog box on page 131 where you name the selected pin. You must name each pin of the symbol.  

7. Click the File > Complete menu item.  

This closes the Part Editor, and the new symbol attaches to the cursor.  

8. Move the cursor to a desired location and click to place the symbol in the schematic.  

9. You can navigate this hierarchy with the View > Push Hierarchy, and View > Pop Hierarchy menu commands.

Creating a Bottom-Up Hierarchy  

## Creating a Bottom-Up Hierarchy

In bottom-up design, you create a hierarchical symbol from an existing sheet that represents the underlying logic. This enables you to create the lower level design and then wrap it in the hierarchical symbol.  

SailWind Logic adds an input or output pin in the symbol for each off-page reference on the schematic sheet. SailWind Logic places off-page references with a pin type of Source on the left side of the hierarchical symbol, and off-page references with a pin type of Load on the right side. (Pin types for offpage references are defined in the library under electrical.)  

**Procedure** 

1. Switch to the sheet to which you want to add the hierarchical symbol. If needed, add a new schematic sheet to the sheet set using the Setup > Sheets menu item.   
2. On the Schematic Editing toolbar, click the New Hierarchical Symbol button.   
3. On the Hierarchical Symbol Wizard dialog box, select an existing sheet from the Sheet Number dropdown list box in the Hierarchical Sheet section.   
4. Type a name for the symbol in the Sheet Name text box.   
5. Select your preferred Pin Decal for both input and output pins from the appropriate dropdown list box.  

The Preview area displays the symbol outline. The number of input/output pins on the symbol is automatically set from the number and type of off-sheet reference symbols on the underlying schematic sheet and the pin count boxes are unavailable for editing.  

6. Click OK.

The hierarchical symbol appears in the Part Editor on page 109 window. An input or output pin is located on the symbol to match each off-page reference on the underlying schematic sheet.  

7. Click the File > Complete menu item.  

This closes the Part Editor, and the new symbol attaches to the cursor.  

8. Move the cursor to a desired location and click to place the symbol in the schematic.  

9. You can navigate this hierarchy with the View > Push Hierarchy and View > Pop Hierarchy menu commands.

## Pushing Into the Hierarchy

Use the Push Hierarchy command to look inside or push down into a hierarchical symbol to view the underlying logic.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the View > Push Hierarchy menu item.   
2. Select the hierarchical symbol.  

Alternatively, you can select the hierarchical symbol, right-click and click Push Hierarchy.  

0 Tip If there is no underlying schematic representation of the selected symbol, a blank sheet appears.  

## Popping Up the Hierarchy

Use the Pop Hierarchy command to replace the current sheet with its corresponding hierarchical symbol.  

**Procedure** 

In a hierarchical sub-schematic, click the View > Pop Hierarchy menu item.

Tip In the Sheets list on the main toolbar, a sub-schematic is displayed with an indented icon.  

## Modifying a Hierarchical Symbol

Once created, you can modify a hierarchical symbol to add or subtract design detail.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select a hierarchical symbol, right-click and click Edit Hierarchical Symbol.  

2. Modify the symbol in the Part Editor on page 109.  

3. Click the File > Complete menu item when you are finished with the changes.  

!Tip  

If you add terminals to a hierarchical symbol, ensure that you give them pin names, and that the names also appear as off-page references in the sheet with the underlying schematic.

## Copying a Hierarchical Symbol

When you copy a hierarchical symbol, the sheets that the symbol references will also be copied and added as new sheets to the schematic. SailWind Logic assigns new reference designators to the part types in the copied sheets. If the referenced sheet also contains hierarchical symbols, then SailWind  

Logic also copies the sheets referenced by those symbols, and so on, down the entire sub-tree of the hierarchy.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select the symbol in the design.  

When you select a hierarchical symbol in copy mode, a warning prompt appears. If you click Yes in the prompt window, SailWind Logic copies the hierarchical symbol, and all directly or indirectly referenced sheets. If any numbered sheets are referenced, SailWind Logic assigns the copies new sheet numbers.  

2. Ctr $^+$ drag a copy.   
3. In the warning prompt, click Yes. The symbol copy attaches to the cursor.   
4. Click the place the symbol.

## Deleting a Hierarchical Symbol

You can delete a hierarchical symbol, but use caution when performing the operation.  

**Procedure** 

1. On the Schematic Editing Toolbar, click the Delete button.   
2. When you select a hierarchical symbol in delete mode, the message “OK to delete sheets associated with the hierarchy - Warning: there is no Undo for this operation” appears. Be sure of your intent before confirming the command. If you click Yes, SailWind Logic deletes the hierarchical symbol and any associated sheets throughout the hierarchy. • If you click No, and it is a hierarchical symbol without a sheet number, SailWind Logic assigns the next unused sheet number and it becomes a normal, numbered sheet.
