## View Control  

You can use several methods to control which portion of the database is visible on the screen.  

View Commands and Scroll Bars Middle Mouse Button Numeric Keypad Saving and Restoring Views  

### View Commands and Scroll Bars  

There are a number of different ways to interact with the design environment to control the view of the design. SailWind Logic provides a comprehensive set of commands to enable you to pan and zoom within the design including using the mouse buttons/wheel, keyboard shortcuts and various items on the View menu.  

To control the view, use the scroll bars or the following commands in the View menu:  

• Click the View $>$ Zoom menu item, or the Zoom button on the toolbar to enter Zoom mode. ◦ To zoom in, position the cursor at the desired view center, and click the left mouse button. ◦ To zoom out, position the cursor at the desired view center, and click the right mouse button. ◦ To define a specific view area, position the cursor at the desired view center, click and drag to define the extents, and release. Click the View $>$ Redraw menu item, or the Refresh button on the toolbar to redraw the current view.   
Click the View $>$ Sheet menu item, or the Sheet button on the toolbar to display the entire sheet.   
Click the View $>$ Extents menu item to resize the view to display all objects in the design.   
• Use the scroll bars to pan the view.  

### Middle Mouse Button  

You can use the middle mouse button to perform a number of viewing operations.  

Use the middle mouse button to perform panning and zooming operations:  

To pan, click the middle mouse button. The view is centered at the cursor. To zoom in, click and hold the middle mouse button. Drag the cursor diagonally up. To adjust the bounding box, move the mouse. When you release the middle mouse button, the area within the bounding box displays.  

To zoom out, click and hold the middle mouse button. Drag the cursor diagonally down. This draws an inner box, representing the current view. Moving the cursor adjusts the outer box, which represents the new view. The relative size of the outer box to the inner box determines how far the view zooms out. Release the middle mouse button to complete the zoom out operation.  

• To view the entire design, click and hold the middle mouse button, drag the cursor horizontally, and release.  

### Numeric Keypad  

Use the numeric keyboard to control the view.  

For more information, see Using the Numeric Keypad to Control the View.  

### Saving and Restoring Views  

If you repeatedly pan or zoom to a particular area of your design, you can save time by saving a work area view so that you can instantly restore it when needed.  

Restriction: Capture is not available while in the Part Editor.

**Procedure** 

Right-click and click Clear to clear the session log display each time you open a file.  

**Results**  

This prevents you from viewing information from a previously opened file. It does not delete the log file.  

### Macros  

You can create macros to simplify redundant activities. You can record any set of procedural steps for replay as a single action. You can also nest macros.  

![](/images/693e72d7f1168195f68c78815669cc65bc602cb2cbaf444b346c3d237906c74b.jpg)  

!Tip  

Dialog box actions are recorded as results rather than actions, so when you replay, you don't see the dialog boxes in the replay process. Because of this you can't create a macro that stops on an open dialog box; it must follow through to some result or action. For example, you can create a macro that selects the File $>$ Open menu item, selects a file, and selects OK. The macro, when played back, opens a file.

Opening an Existing Macro File   
Viewing Multiple Open Macros   
Editing a Macro   
Changing the Default Text Editor   
Saving the Macro  

#### Creating a New Macro  

Macros can be very flexible and helpful beyond your current design session. You can create a new macro by recording your keystrokes, mouse movements and commands and then save it for later recall.  

**Procedure** 

1. On the main toolbar, click the Output Window button.   
2. On the Macro tab, click the New button. New macros are given a name of Macro#, where # is a numeric sequence such as Macro1 or Macro2.   
3. If desired, click the Compress mouse moves and/or Relative mouse moves buttons. See Recording Mouse Movements for more information.   
4. On the Macro tab toolbar, click the Record button.   
5. Perform the keystrokes, commands, and mouse clicks to include in the macro.   
6. On the Macro tab toolbar, click the Stop button. Alternatively, you can also script a macro instead of recording mouse actions.  

#### Recording Mouse Movements  

Mouse movements are recorded in macros. You can record compressed or uncompressed mouse movements and relative or absolute movements.  

Compress Mouse Mode — Compress mouse mode records only the start point and endpoint of a mouse movement. It does not record any of the intermediate coordinates between the start and end points. Compression is recommended under most circumstances because it significantly reduces the size of your macro file. Recording intermediate mouse movements increases the file size, but documents coordinate information if required for a special application.  

Relative Mouse Mode — Relative mouse mode records the start point and endpoint of a movement in incremental coordinates instead of absolute coordinates.  

#### Opening an Existing Macro File  

Macros are created in and stored in macro files that have a .mcr extension. To open an existing macro file (.mcr), you can use the menus or the toolbar.  

You can open multiple macros in the macro editor. The macro editor also supports nested macros.  

**Procedure** 

1. On the main toolbar, click the Output Window button; then, in the Output window, click the Macro tab. 2. Click the Open button, or select the macro file in the Open File dialog box and click Open.  

#### Viewing Multiple Open Macros  

You can switch your view between multiple open macros. This enables you move back and forth between more than one macro without having to open and close them individually.  

**Procedure** 

Click a macro in the List of Open Macros area (left-hand pane) of the Macro tab to switch between open macros.  

#### Editing a Macro  

You can copy or cut selected text to the Clipboard. You can also paste the selection from the Clipboard into the text window. You can paste text from the Clipboard into other applications. You can also switch between open macros to edit multiple macros.  

![](/images/65a927d196cad38e7667d7905a6818115b8071b09a312de0ca82a2bb618d59cb.jpg)  

**Restriction:**  

If you have Notepad as the default text editor, longer macro files may not be loaded because of size constraints in Notepad. See Changing the Default Text Editor for information on how to change the default text editor.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select the text you want to copy or cut.   
2. On the Macro tab toolbar, click the Copy or Cut buttons.   
3. Place the pointer at the insertion point where you want to place the copied text.  

4. On the Macro tab toolbar, click the Paste button.  

You will see that your selection has been pasted in the Output window at the insertion point.  

As an alternative, right-click in the Output window and click Copy, Cut, or Paste.  

#### Changing the Default Text Editor

Note: The comparision is conducted on the basis of CIS attribute Part_Number.  

3. Check the search results in the Part Attribute Info. area, where errors are highlighted in red. You can also:  

• Use the filter to search for specific part(s) by the reference designator, schematic sheet, part number, error type, or the Show Error Only button.  

Note:   
Filtering by Component Name or Part Number is case-sensitive and no wildcard or expression is currently supported.  

• Click on any item in the table, and in the "Comparision Results" area see respective attribute values assigned in design and CIS, with differences highlighted in red.  

4. Update inconsistent schematic part attribute(s) from CIS in either of the following ways, which takes effect only on parts found with "Attribute is not equal" error.  

• Click Update All to update all inconsistent part attributes from CIS. Select one or more items in the table, and click Update the Selected to update the inconsistent attributes of the selected parts only. Use Ctrl for multiple selections.   
• Update attribute(s) for a specific part in the "Comparision Results" area, with two available options: • Update the selected attribute: Right-click on the attribute cell and click the Update Selected Attribute From CIS popup menu item • Update all attributes: Right-click and click the Update Selected Part From CIS popup menu item  

## Opening a File That is Already in Use  

The SailWind products help you avoid making changes to a file that is already opened by another user.  

The first user to open a file in a shared location becomes the owner of the file for the duration the file is open; the file is locked to all other users. If you try to open a file that someone else has already opened, you will get a warning message letting you know the current owner and the name of the computer from where the file is locked. You have the option to view a read-only version of the file but you will not be able to update it while the owner still has it open. You can save the file with another name using Save As.  

Use the file operations to create and save a new schematic file. You can also open and save existing designs, import and export files from other file formats, and archive your schematics.
