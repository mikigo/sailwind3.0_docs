# Chapter 17 Reports  

You can generate reports to view and analyze data related to your design. Available reports include unused pins, parts statistics, net statistics, limits, connectivity, and a bill of materials. Use these reports to examine and interpret your design status at any point in the design cycle.  

Generating Reports The Bill of Materials Report  

## Generating Reports

Use the Reports dialog box to produce any of six different types of reports on the current schematic. You can save these reports as text files on your hard disk or output them to a printer.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Reports menu item.   
2. In the Reports Dialog Box, select each report you want to generate.   
3. To specify or modify the report characteristics of the Bill of Materials report, click Setup. See also The Bill of Materials Report.   
4. Click OK. The reports are generated and the dialog box closes.  

## The Bill of Materials Report

The Bill of Materials report produces a user-configurable list of the parts contained in the current schematic. You can direct any part attribute in the schematic to a Bill of Materials report.  

In the Bill of Materials Setup dialog box on page 479 are three different tabs for controlling report characteristics from which to choose:  

Setting Up the Bill of Materials Attributes Setting Up the Bill of Materials Format Setting Up the Bill of Materials Configuration  

### Setting Up the Bill of Materials Attributes

Use the Attributes tab to modify the Attribute content, the corresponding column headings, and column width of the report.  

The attribute order in the content list determines the column arrangement in the BOM report. There is a limit of 12 attributes in the Bill of Materials report.  

**Restrictions and Limitations**  

Including non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts in the bill of materials is constrained. See Options Dialog Box, Design Category for details.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Reports menu item.  

2. In the Reports Dialog Box select the Bill of Materials check box and then click Setup to specify or modify the Bill of Materials report characteristics.  

3. In the Bill of Materials Setup dialog box on page 479, click the Attributes tab.  

4. To add a new attribute to the list, click Add and select an attribute from the list in the Part Attribute column,  

!Tip  

You can list up to twelve attribute names. Each attribute defines a column in the BOM report.  

5. In the Field Header column, specify the column heading for each attribute in the report. You can specify any character except the colon ( : ).  

6. In the Width column, type an integer between 1 and 200 that represents the number of characters across the column for each attribute in the report.  

!Tip  

SailWind Logic reserves a space to separate columns. Therefore, the actual column width is one character less than the specified number.  

7. To move an attribute up a row, select the attribute to move and click Up.  

8. To move an attribute down a row, select the attribute to move and click Down.  

9. To edit an attribute, select the box to edit and click Edit.  

**Restriction:**  

You cannot edit the part attribute name, but you can select a new attribute to replace the one currently listed.  

10. To remove an attribute from the report, select the row and click Remove.  

11. To restore the default content from the .ini file, click Reset.  

12. Click OK.  

### Setting Up the Bill of Materials Format

Use the Format tab to modify the output format of the Bill of Material report. This enables you to specify which fields to display and how the information will be displayed in the generated report.  

The default settings originate from the .ini file.  

**Restrictions and Limitations**  

Including non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts in the bill of materials is constrained. See Options Dialog Box, Design Category for details.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Reports menu item.   
2. In the Reports Dialog Box select the Bill of Materials check box and then click Setup to specify or modify the Bill of Materials report characteristics.  

3. In the Bill of Materials Setup dialog box on page 483, click the Format tab.  

4. Select the type of delimiter you want to distinguish the report columns.  

• Separator — places a vertical bar between report fields Tab — separates columns with a tab spacing Comma — places a comma character between report fields Custom — specify any character as a delimiter  

5. Type a report title in the Report Title box.  

0 Tip The variable %j is replaced by the filename and $\%\text{\textperthousand}$ is replaced by the date.  

6. Select the Combine Value/Tolerance check box to combine the Value and Tolerance attributes of a part in the part name.  

For example, the 1/4 watt resistor would have a part type name of R1/4W or $R1/4\mathsf{W}.4.7\mathsf{K},+/-5\%$ . SailWind Logic evaluates parts that have either a different Value or Tolerance attribute as different part types.  

7. In the Ref. Designator Separation Mode settings choose between giving each component a single line (Single Ref. Designator per line) or displaying the reference designators of identical components on one line (Multiple Ref. Designators per line).  

If you choose multiple reference designators per line, you can also specify to compress ranges of reference designators and the delimiter between them.  

8. Select an attribute in which to sort the report list in the Sort By list.  

![](/images/dff7ccc84e1755fc9604b8a9a644dcf99f9f1056c8c243d985ce29bbebaadc38.jpg)  

Select None to sort by Part Type.  

9. Select the output file format from the File Format list.  

10. To save report format settings for the current design to a specified file so you can create different format configurations for different designs, click Save As and type a filename the Save Scheme dialog box.  

SailWind Logic saves BOM format settings files in the \Settings folder with a .bom extension.

Tip Click Delete to remove the selected setting file from the list.  

11. To restore the default content from the .ini file, click Reset.  

12. Click OK.  

### Setting Up the Bill of Materials Configuration

Use the BOM Config tab to preview the Bill of Materials report format and copy any selected lines of the file to a Windows clipboard. You can also export the BOM report to a TXT/CSV file.  

The default view orders the attributes by the sort field you specified on the Format tab.  

**Restrictions and Limitations**  

Including non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts in the bill of materials is constrained. See Options Dialog Box, Design Category for details.  

**Procedure** 

1. Click the File > Reports menu item.  

2. In the Reports Dialog Box select the Bill of Materials check box and then click Setup to specify or modify the Bill of Materials report characteristics.  

3. In the Bill of Materials Setup dialog box, click the BOM Config tab.  

4. To sort rows by an attribute other than the one you set on the Format tab, click the heading area of the attribute you want to sort.  

To sort the same column in reverse order, click again.  

5. Copy any selected lines of the file to a Windows clipboard:  

a. To include the column header information in the report, select the Include table header check box.   
b. Select the rows you want to copy to the clipboard and click Copy.  

Tip Click Select All to select the entire table.  

6. Export to a TXT/CSV file.  

a. To exclude any row in the report, select the NC checkbox.   
b. Click Export, and choose the file type in the popup dialog box.  

7. Click OK.
