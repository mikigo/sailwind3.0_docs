## Reference Designator Renumbering

Manually renumber single or automatically renumber reference designators in the schematic. SailWind Layout can renumber the reference designators automatically in a pattern, to optimize finding your parts on a manufactured printed circuit board. Once the parts are renumbered in SailWind Layout, you can synchronize the designs again by back annotating an .eco file of the changed designators.  

To manually renumber a reference designator in SailWind Logic, see Changing the Reference Designator.  

To automatically renumber reference designators in SailWind Logic, see “Automatically Renumbering Reference Designators” on page 280.  

To automatically renumber the reference designators in SailWind Layout, see Changing the Reference Designators of Multiple Components in ECO Mode (Autorenumbering) in the SailWind Layout Guide.  

## Automatically Renumbering Reference Designators

Renumber reference designators on a sheet by sheet basis with control over the starting value, increment, and pattern.  

**Procedure** 

1. On the Schematic Editing toolbar, click the Auto Renumber Parts button  

2. In the “Auto Renumber Parts Dialog Box” on page 473, select the sheets to renumber.

4. If needed, set the Cell size to smaller cells. See the example below.  

5. Set the Renumber settings for your situation.  

6. Set the Precedence pattern.  

7. Click OK.  

An ECO file is automatically generated. If the Output window is open, a link to the file appears in the log. If the output window is closed, the ECO file opens in your default text editor.  

8. If the board layout has already been started in SailWind Layout, you must import the ECO file to update the reference designators in SailWind Layout. This exact file must be used. Do not overwrite this file with a new one or generate an ECO file using the Compare/ECO Tools until SailWind Layout has been updated with the renumbering. In SailWind Layout, click the File $>$ Import menu item. Browse for the .eco file and import the changes.  

**Examples**

The following graphic displays the result of a smaller cell size on the parts in the schematic. Cell borders have been drawn to illustrate how it works. The parts within the cells are renumbered in the Precedence pattern and then the cells also are processed in the same pattern.

## Modify Buses

Use the Bus Properties dialog box to change the name of a bus or change the bus type.  

Changing the Name of a Bus Changing the Bus Type Managing Bus Nets  

### Changing the Name of a Bus

As your design evolves, you may need to add or delete nets to or from a bus. Once you have made these modifications, you can change the name of a bus to reflect those changes.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select a bus, right-click and click Properties.   
2. Type a new name for the bus in the Bus Name box or select an existing name from the list. See also Naming Buses.  

!Tip  

If you change the bit range for a bit format bus, the new bit range nn:mm must be equal to or greater than the old bit range. The signals attached to the bus will keep their old bit number, but take the new name.  

3. In the Rename area, click This instance to apply the new bus name to the selected bus, or click All instances to apply the new bus name to all instances of this bus.  

4. Select the Bus Name Label check box to add a visible label to the selected bus.  

### Changing the Bus Type

As your design evolves, you may find it necessary to change the type of a bus from a bit format bus to a mixed net bus or the other way around. You can use Properties to change the bus type.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select a bus, right-click and click Properties.   
2. In the Bus Type area, click the bus type you want. The Bus Type determines which bus names appear in the Bus Name list.  

!Tip  

If you change the bus type from bit format to mixed net bus, the bus name changes to just the prefix. The bus name prefix and bit range are added to the Bus Nets list box.

**Restriction:**  

You can change a mixed net bus to a bit format bus only if all of the connected nets conform to the bit sequenced names, which you define in the Bus Name text box. Before you can change a mixed net bus to a bit format bus, you must delete the bus nets from the Bus Nets list box.  

### Managing Bus Nets

You may find it necessary to expand the range of a bus to include additional sequential nets. Use Properties to add sequential nets to a bus.  

**Restrictions and Limitations**  

The Bus Nets area is not available when the Bit Format bus type is selected.  

**Procedure** 

1. Select a bus, right-click and click Properties.   
2. Click Add to add a new row in the Bus Nets list.   
3. Type the bus prefix in the Name/Prefix column.  

!Tip  

Use the following naming conventions:  

• For a single net, type the net name.   
• For a range of sequential nets, type the prefix for the sequence of nets.  

4. In the Start column, type the starting bit number for a sequence of nets.  

5. In the End column, type the ending bit number for a sequence of nets.  

!Tip  

To add an individual net to the bus, type the net name in the Prefix/Name column. Do not type Start and End values for a single net that is not sequenced by bit number.  

6. Click Edit to modify a selected cell in the Bus Nets list.  

7. Click Delete to remove a net from the Bus nets list.  

8. Click Down to move the selected row down one position in the Bus Nets list.  

0 Tip The order in which nets appear in the Bus Nets list determines the default order for naming nets as they are connected to a bus.  

9. Click Up to move the selected row up one position in the Bus Nets list.
